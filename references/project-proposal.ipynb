    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to investigate if there is a correlation between the household income and the death rate in the United States of America. In order to explore this relation, we gathered data on both topics and will analyse how and to what extense the death rate is impacted by the household income.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to answer the following question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does the household income have an impact on the deathrates in the U.S. and if yes, how big is it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictor variable will be the median household income and the response variable will be the age-adjusted death rate. Further insight can be gained by using categories like death cause, state or year (see Analysis Approach)\n",
    "Other useful information will be provided by the absolute amount of total deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is backed by the following studies:\n",
    "* KINGE, Jonas Minet, et al. Association of household income with life expectancy and cause-specific mortality in Norway, 2005-2015. Jama, 2019, 321. Jg., Nr. 19, S. 1916-1925. (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2733322)\n",
    "* KAPLAN, George A., et al. Inequality in income and mortality in the United States: analysis of mortality and potential pathways. Bmj, 1996, 312. Jg., Nr. 7037, S. 999-1003. (https://www.bmj.com/content/312/7037/999.full)\n",
    "* Oâ€™CONNOR, Gerald T., et al. Median household income and mortality rate in cystic fibrosis. Pediatrics, 2003, 111. Jg., Nr. 4, S. e333-e339. (https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/111/4/e333/63113/Median-Household-Income-and-Mortality-Rate-in)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the first study was done in Norway and the second study investigates mortality instead of death rate, we suspect to gather similar observations.\n",
    "Therefore our hypotheses regarding the research question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The household income and the death rate will have a negative correlation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning, that the higher the household income is, the lower the death rate will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Added information on mortality vs mortality rate/death rate:\n",
    "*Mortality is a fact that refers to susceptibility to death. While there is a crude death rate that refers to number of deaths in a population in a year, mortality rate is the number of deaths per thousand people over a period of time that is normally a year.* \n",
    "\n",
    "See: \n",
    "* https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-death-rate-and-vs-mortality-rate/\n",
    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Added information on age-adjustment:\n",
    "*In epidemiology and demography, age adjustment, also called age standardization, is a technique used to allow statistical populations to be compared when the age profiles of the populations are quite different. The effects of the age factor are adjusted or standardized.* \n",
    "\n",
    "See: \n",
    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_adjustment\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, you will describe the data set you wish to explore. This includes\n",
    "\n",
    "-   description of the observations in the data set,\n",
    "-   description of how the data was originally collected (not how you found the data but how the original curator of the data collected it).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two data sets which we will combine by joining on the state and year column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is about the 10 leading death causes in the United States, beginning in 1999. Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia using demographic and medical characteristics. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates after 2010 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data set we have 10868 cases and 6 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns are:\n",
    "* years, from 1999 to 2017\n",
    "* 113 cause name, the NDI ICD-10 113 categories for causes of death\n",
    "* cause name, the generic name for the death cause defined in the 113 cause name column\n",
    "* state, in which state the data was collected\n",
    "* death, the count of the total deaths \n",
    "* age-adjusted death rate, the standardized death percentage for the specific state in the observed year."
