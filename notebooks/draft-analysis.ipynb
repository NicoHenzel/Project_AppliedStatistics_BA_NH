    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to investigate, whether there is a correlation between the household income and the death rate in the United States of America. In order to explore this relation, we gathered data on both topics and will analyse how and to what extense the death rate is impacted by the household income.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does the household income have an impact on the deathrates in the U.S. and if yes, how big is it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictor variable will be the median household income and the response variable will be the age-adjusted death rate. Further insights can be gained by using categories like death cause, state or year. Other useful information will be provided by the amount of total deaths.\n",
    "The data dictionary below, is showing more details about the required variables."
