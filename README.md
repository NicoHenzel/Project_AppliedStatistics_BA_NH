## Applied Statistics project 
Winter semester 2022 at Hochschule der Medien in Stuttgart, Germany

### Project description

The motivation is to formulate a hypothesis which can be answered using a linear regression model.

The goal for this is to use statistical methods together with machine learning models in python to inspect the relation of two numeric variables. To achieve this, we need to formulate a use case with a predictor and a response variable.

* The ideas can be found in the [topic-ideas](https://github.com/NicoHenzel/Project_AppliedStatistics_BA_NH/blob/main/references/topic-ideas.ipynb) notebook.
* The [project-proposal](https://github.com/NicoHenzel/Project_AppliedStatistics_BA_NH/blob/main/references/project-proposal.ipynb) shows the use case.
* The model is built in [draft-analysis](https://github.com/NicoHenzel/Project_AppliedStatistics_BA_NH/blob/main/notebooks/draft-analysis.ipynb).
* In the [reports](https://github.com/NicoHenzel/Project_AppliedStatistics_BA_NH/tree/main/reports) folder, you can find the final conclusion as well as a presentation of it.
